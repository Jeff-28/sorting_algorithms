# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are well, that a program that sorts a given array or list in increasing order.

Big O notation is a way to analyze the efficiency of a program or function

## Sorting algorithms:

The sorting algorithms will take a given array or list and sort it into a ascending order in the case of *__ints__* or in alphabetical order in the case where the array holds an *__str__*.

The different types of sorting algorithms:
- [Buble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

## Big O Notation:
As mentioned before Big 
O notation is a way to analyze the efficiency of a program or function.

## General:
* Editor: *nvim*
* All files compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**.
* All files end in *newline*.
* Code uses **Betty** style linter:
  * [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl)
  * [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
```bash
$betty <filename>
```

* No more than **5** functions per file.
* All codes tested with their corresponding ***main.c*** in the **mains/** directory.
* All codes and functions compiled using:
```bash
$gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename>.c -o
```
or
```bash
$gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename>.c -o <out_name>
```
* All function prototypes are present in the ***sort.h*** header file.
